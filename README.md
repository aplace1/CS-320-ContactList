## Prompts
### **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
    I ensure my software is functional and secure by exercising proper programming etiquette.
    Prior to diving into coding, having a visual or note can help maintain structure.
    Additionally, I will create unit-tests to make certain both current and future functionality 
    is correct and works effectively.


### **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
    I interpret user needs by applying active listening skills to better understand what a client requires.
    They may not know exactly what they need or want. By listening for keywords, I can achieve an understanding
    and request the client to elaborate on a topic if necessary.

### **How do I approach designing software?**
    I approach software development by breaking down the main goal into smaller pieces.
    After analyzing and sorting through each piece, I create the basic structure and implement the required functionality.

### **Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
    The project focuses on learning the fundamentals to unit-testing. It does not function as a useable program yet.

### **What did you do particularly well?**
    The project was structured decently; I do not usually think about what was done well. 
    Instead, I prefer to think about how I can improve.

### **Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etcetera?**
    I would implement a local database so that the program is usable. I would also like to implement a better 
    algorithm for sorting and searching. A linear algorithm is not efficient and will 
    become slower as more contacts are added.

### **Did you find writing any piece of the code challenging and how did you overcome this?**
    I did not find any of this code particularly difficult. I have worked with Java in 
    the past which made this project significantly easier.

### **What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**
    Using the Junit framework will help for other projects regarding Java.
    I can see myself using this in the future for unit-testing.

### **What Skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**
    The use of unit-testing is applicable to numerous other projects. In this course specifically,
    with this project, the focus was primarily the Junit-Framework.
