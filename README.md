## Prompts
### **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
    I ensure my software is functional and secure by exercising proper programming etiquette.
    Prior to diving into coding, having a visual or note can help maintain structure.
    Additionally, I will create unit-tests to make certain both current and future functionality 
    is correct and works effectively.


### **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
    I interpret user needs by applying active listening skills to better understand what a client requires.
    They may not know exactly what they need or want. By listening for keywords, I can achieve an understanding
    and request the client to elaborate on a topic if necessary.

### **How do I approach designing software?**
    I approach software development by breaking down the main goal into smaller pieces.
    After analyzing and sorting through each piece, I create the basic structure and implement the required functionality.
